%!TEX root = globs.tex

In this work we seek to better understand globs as a feature, the developer practices around using them, and to support research targeting challenges that software developers face 
when using them. Thus, we focus on the following research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item [\textbf{RQ1}]Are features uniform across globbing implementations and, if not, how do these features differ?
\item [\textbf{RQ2}]Do differences in globbing behavior and dialect impact usability/reliability and to what extent? 
\item [\textbf{RQ3}]Are there common classes of correctness and security issues encountered with globs?
\item [\textbf{RQ4}]How comprehensive are globbing languages in addressing the tasks encountered in practice?
\end{enumerate}
