{\bf Glob Sampling Bias:} Our methodology for procuring the glob corpus faces two threats. First, our corpus is composed of globs sampled from publicly available projects on 
github in a fixed range of programming languages. If these sets are not sufficiently representative of the true distribution then our results may be biased. To counteract this 
risk, we selected a range of the most popular programming languages. Second, our selection methodology involved using a set of extraction regular expressions that may miss some 
uses of globs. To reduce this risk we randomly spot-checked and refined the extraction pipeline to ensure high coverage.

{\bf Discussion Bias and Categorization:} Our methodology for gathering and analyzing developer discourse on globs also contains two possible threats to validity. First, is 
possible sampling bias in the forums selected and the self-selection of developers that post on these sites. Our choice of the most popular forums should ensure that the results 
are representative of programming topics that are generally relevant. As data collection was keyword-based we manually evaluated both potentials for false positives and 
false negatives in our results. The second threat to validity of the results based on this analysis are the miss-classification of posts on topics. Our preliminary classification 
was based on keyword matches but was then hand refined to ensure that labeling was accurate.
